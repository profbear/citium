  <br/>
  Invoke with
  <kbd>ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>alt</kbd>-<kbd>shift</kbd>-<kbd>x</kbd>,
  or by selecting text and right-click the editor to show
  the context menu. The menu item is called <b>Pipe selected

  the bash argument window.

<p>
  Being able to run anything in the editor and change the buffer text
  was heavily inspired by emacs's lisp expressions
  <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Lisp-Eval.html#Lisp-Eval">
    (eval-last-sexp), (eval-defun) and (eval-expression)</a>, and the
  Shell Process plugin.
